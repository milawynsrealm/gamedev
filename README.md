Lee's Game Development Library
==============================

This library is designed to provide support for cross-platform game development across several desktop platforms (e.g. Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, etc.) in a compact and lightweight fashion. However, it is currently not designed to be a complete replacement to existing multimedia libraries (e.g. [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/), [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), etc.).

Note for Windows Developers
===========================
This library is currently designed to be able to run comfortably in Windows XP or later. Although that version is now considered to be deprecated by most people, the open source development of [ReactOS](http://reactos.org/) has for the moment kept that support alive. However, if the kernel target of ReactOS should switch to a later version of Windows, this policy may also change.
